## **Project Description**

something

This project aims to build a job site network, allowing multiple front-end job boards to display listings from a central backend based on user-defined settings. This network will:

- **Support underserved communities:** Job posting companies can promote roles across specialized job boards through a single admin panel, improving access for diverse applicant pools.
- **Reduce redundancy:** The system will automatically scrape jobs from existing boards, notifying job posters of cross-postings and prompting account activation. This streamlines cross-posting and aligns with government initiatives for broader job promotion.
- **Enhance accessibility:** The system focuses on accessibility and community engagement.
- **Improve job descriptions:** Leverage Large Language Model (LLM) APIs to empower users to create more compelling job posting descriptions.

## **Programming Language(s)**

This web-based job portal will utilize:

- **Front-end:** React
- **Backend:** Supabase (SQL)
- **External APIs:**
    - Stripe for payment processing
    - OpenAI for LLM functionalities
    - Auth0 for user authentication

## **Hardware/Software Requirements**

- **Frontend Development:** React
- **Backend Database Management:** Supabase (SQL)
- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **Development Environment:**
    - IDE suitable for React development
    - Web browser for testing
- **Computational Resources:** Cloud-based infrastructure and servers to host the job boards and admin panel.

## **Current Work/Arrangement**

Currently, job postings are often restricted to individual platforms, limiting exposure to a wider range of potential candidates. This often necessitates manual cross-posting across multiple platforms, leading to repetitive and time-consuming work.
